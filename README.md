# Leaflet Homework - Visualizing Data with Leaflet

### Level 1: Basic Visualization

1. **Get your data set**

https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_month.geojson

2. **Import & Visualize the Data**

   Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.
   You will find the day/time, magnitude, and depth in the tooltip once a marker is clicked
